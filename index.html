            <p>
                <strong>Hello</strong> <br>
                <strong>Thank you</strong> for visiting my page and taking a moment to learn a little about me.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Who am I:</strong>
                I am person who pushes myself beyond my own expectations to discover new frontiers. I am motivated
                to
                learn and grow in order to help myself and loved ones as best I can.
                I am the oldest in my family out of 4 siblings(1 brother and 2 sisters). I was born in
                Puebla,Puebla,
                Mexico and brought to San Bernardino, CA, USA at the age of 6. I am a Dreamer who is currently part
                of
                the Deffered Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA. I focus on what is within my capability to change
                and
                don't worry to much about what is beyond my control. However, I do my best to prepare for the
                unexpected
                by having different game plans just in case my original one does not work.
                <p>
                    <strong>What I Enjoy:</strong>
                    I like to fail fast and often to learn from my mistakes. Its not that i like to fail, rather its
                    a
                    step closer to learing something new and being good at it. I have always liked to learn how
                    things
                    work and can't help myself from taking things apart to figure out how they work. Beside, taring
                    things apart i enjoy spending quality time with my family. My favorite thing to do is to try
                    something new such as skydiving, snowboarding, surfing or just a different type of food and then
                    bring others along to experience what I have enjoyed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>What I Don't like:</strong>
                    I don't like to be micromanaged. I don't like to wait in long lines. Other than that I don't
                    complain too much.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>What I have Achived:</strong>
                    First of all I am alive and well.
                    I graduated high school.
                    I am not in jail.
                    I am not a teen parent.
                    I am drug-free.
                    Believe it or not, many old friends and family can't say the same.
                    I have an A.A. in: Physics, Mathamatics, Chemisty. I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineer.
                    I am a homeowner of two homes, best thing is they pay for themselves.
                    I have paid of my first car and debt free(beside mortgages).
